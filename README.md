Project Sierra
=============

RPG centered game design suite using Java Swing and libGDX.

What is this you ask? Well to put it simply, it's a project designed to waste my time, because I have too much time that isn't being spent programming.

But seriously.

I want a simple to use Java utility that allows the quick creation of RPG style games. These games can be easily loaded into the "engine" (also in Java, using libGDX) at runtime. This means that all of the components of the game (assets, logic, etc) are defined as a bunch of non-standardized, proprietary, difficult to work with files that I design on a whim. Fantastic.

Doesn't this exist already you ask?

Yes.

If you have ever worked with modding Fallout/Elder Scrolls, I basically want that.

So thats that.

Right now it mostly consists of a hodge podge of incomplete code that I've started on and off over the last few months. TilsetCreator was completed ages ago for something else, but is still relevent for this task. The MainGame is currently, or rather temporarily, programmed to accept it's output.

You can tell I've done a lot of planning. :P

Oh and another thing. The utilities rely on ViaWareAPI, which is another hodge podge of code accumulated from different projects. It's got some database stuff, GUI stuff, utilities, etc, it's probably useful for things. ViaWareAPI in turn relies on sqlite4java for its database functionality. You can grab that at https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/

No. I'm not using anything for dependency management right now. It might be on a todo list somewhere. Probably not.
